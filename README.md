# Project Index

A little tool to provide an index page for all of your current projects.

## Installation

Clone or copy this into the directory where you keep your projects/sites.

I use Laravel Valet, so I've put this where Valet is "parked".

## Advanced

The raw CSS is in `./tailwind.css`, and this gets built to `./public/public.css`. There are currently no customisations.

If you want to update or change tailwind, just run `yarn build` afterwards.
